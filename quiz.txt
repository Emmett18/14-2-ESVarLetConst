## **Quiz**

- What is the difference between ***var*** and ***let***?
    -let is block scoped, var is assigned to the window object. You can reasign and redeclare
with var but only reassign with let. Var can be hoisted because variables are declared first with var.
- What is the difference between **var** and ***const***?
    -Can't redeclare or reassign with const, can do both with var. Const is block scoped like let,
which means the variable is accesable only in the parent code block {}
- What is the difference between **let** and **const**?
    -The same but let can redeclare and const can't.
- What is hoisting?
    -How the JS compiler works.Variables are "hoisted" to the top of the scope they're declared in.
This allows us to access the variable name, but not it's value, before it is used. Function declarations are
also hoisted.
